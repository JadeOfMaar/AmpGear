# ThorTech
Turn your spaceplane into a chariot of the Norse gods. Contains old-school and sci-fi electric engines and several complementary parts specialized for easy and steady, but high-wattage operation in any atmosphere, able to meet several new use cases, and with greatly reduced need for liquid tankage. This mod revives and expands another mod, **Electrical Engines**, with thanks to its original author.

**Licenced CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0.** This mod intends to be entirely built on others with this same license or MIT license.

## Dependencies
* B9 Part Switch
* Community Resource Pack
* Kerbal Actuators

## Warning
* Cockpits are very WIP. They're missing transparent glass from IVA view, most internals, seats, and working hatches.
