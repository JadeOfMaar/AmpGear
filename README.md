# ThorTech
Turn your spaceplane into a chariot of the Norse gods. Contains old-school and sci-fi electric engines and some complementary parts specialized for easy but high-wattage operation in any atmosphere, and with reduced need for liquid tankage. This mod revives and expands another mod, **Electrical Engines**, with thanks to its original author.

Contains propfans, turbofans, two VTOL engines, plasma pulse jet engines with turbo, reactors, a radiator, a hybrid plasma aerospike, inline windmill turbines, and battery stacks (cylinder and Mk2).

**Licenced CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0.** This mod intends to be entirely built on others with this same license or MIT license.
