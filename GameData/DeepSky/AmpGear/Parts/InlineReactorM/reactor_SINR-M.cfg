	description = The Shielded Inline Nuclear Reactor series, 2.5m size. Its internals have much less exposure to the atmosphere than most other reactors, and an interlaced sub-dermal Titanium thermal control system throughout its hull and the immediate surrounding parts provides the SINR some decent tolerance against shock heating.
