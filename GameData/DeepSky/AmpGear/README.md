# Electrical Engines Hotwired
For lack of a more interesting and distinct name, this is a revival of a select small parts mod. It provides both old-school and sci-fi engines which run on only ElectricCharge (well, StoredCharge too) and IntakeAtm. The engines in this mod can therefore run indefinitely and in any atmosphere.

Contains propfans, turbofans, two VTOL engines, and plasma pulse jet engines-- with TURBO!
