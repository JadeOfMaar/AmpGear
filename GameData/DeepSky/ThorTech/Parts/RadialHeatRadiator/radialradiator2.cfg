	description = A heat exchanger with a fair portion of its working components set within the ship body behind (or below) it. Unlike the smaller device, this one is engineered and purposed for carrying expendable surplus coolant fluid and using an ablation method to quicker disperse any accumulated heat into space...or into atmosphere.
