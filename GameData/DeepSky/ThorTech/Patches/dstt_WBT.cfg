{
	PART_TIP
	{
		name = dstt_spike
		title = Voyager Aerospike
		description = The Voyager series is an enhanced LFO plasma "SupraLOX" engine. At the cost of a great electric current and thanks to a very different internal system, its Isp is far greater than those of most other aerospike engines.

@PART[dstt_shieldnir*]:NEEDS[WildBlueTools]
{
	PART_TIP
	{
		name = dstt_shieldnir
		title = Shieldnir
		description = This very powerful and very novel device casts a tight-fit electromagnetic forcefield over most parts of a vessel, protecting against shock heating while passing through an atmosphere at immense speeds. It can also be used to protect vessels orbiting near bodies that generate extreme heat.
	}

@PART[dstt_razor*]:NEEDS[WildBlueTools]
{
	PART_TIP
	{
		name = dstt_razor
		title = Multi-Role Engine
		description = The Razor VTOL engine specializes in operation at medium altitudes on Kerbin and at atmosphere pressures at least as great as on Eve. Once it passes Mach 1 it serves as an intake and provides benefit to being attached facing forward. Unlike other WarpJet engines it guzzles air the most and is least fitting for use as an SSTO engine.
	}

@PART[dstt_vtolfan*]:NEEDS[WildBlueTools]
{
	PART_TIP
	{
		name = dstt_vtolfan
		title = Ascendant VTOL Fan
		description = The Ascendant series is the same variant of WarpJet as the Razor series engine but uses just one large fan blade, not arrays of blades as in most jet engines. For its size it's incredibly powerful and functions very well in the thinnest and thickest of atmospheres, but it cannot function beyond Mach 1.

@PART[dstt_RAT*]:NEEDS[WildBlueTools]
{
	PART_TIP
	{
		name = dstt_RAT
		title = Ram Air Turbines
		description = A Thor Tech RAT possesses both a catalytic fluid and great intake surface area, enabling it to show unmatched performance versus known typical forms of RATs. Once this device determines that it's moving at excessive speeds, its shutters close, protecting itself from crushing force and over-spin from incoming air.

	PART_TIP
	{
		name = dstt_radialheatexc
		title = Titanium Convector
		description = This device specializes in drawing heat in from anywhere on a vessel but does not natively possess the surface area to function effectively as a radiator. However, Coolant can be injected through its pipes for an applied burst of cooling potential for as long as the Coolant supply lasts.
	}

@PART[dstt_?INR]:NEEDS[WildBlueTools]
{
	PART_TIP
	{
		name = dstt_sinr
		title = Shielded Inline Nuclear Reactor
		description = Nuclear reactors generally overheat and fail when exposed to shock heating, have very low heat tolerance, and several of them may be required on a Thor Tech equipped craft. The SINR series reactor trades some power generation capacity for a built-in active radiator and higher heat tolerance.
